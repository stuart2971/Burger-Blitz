    The third scene is the pantry, this is where the user will be gathering ingredients to build the burger
    The third scene is the fridge, this is where the user will be gathering ingredients to build the burger
    The coloured objects in the pantry and fridge represent the hitboxes for the ingredients
    The only moveable ingredient is the tomato (red circle). If you click and drag the red circle it will create an instance of the tomato and let you bring it to other scenes.  To bring the tomato to another scene click and hold the tomato and press "a" or "d".
