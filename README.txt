Scenes
    You will first see the main scene (dining room) where the customers will go to order food.  
    The second scene is the kitchen, this is where the user will find the plate to assemble the burger.  
        Note: All burgers must be served on a plate otherwise points will be deducted
    The third scene is the pantry, this is where the user will be gathering ingredients to build the burger
    The fourth scene is the fridge, this is where the user will be gathering ingredients to build the burger

How to Play: 
    You will first start in the main scene.  You will need to remember what the order is on the main scene for when you retrieve the ingredients in the other scenes.  Use the "a" and "d" keys to navigate between scenes.  In the next scene, you will need to pick up the plate by clicking and dragging.  Note that you are able to bring the plate to other scenes by clicking and holding while pressing "a" or "d".  Move between the pantry and kitchen scene to gather the ingredients you need and click and drag them onto the plate.  When you have all the ingredients on the plate, bring the plate to the main scene and place it at the bottom of the screen.  The plate will be cleared and the points will be rewarded depending on the accuracy of the order.  Note that you are not able to clear the plate if you make a mistake, so if one does occur, you will need to submit the plate and move to the next order.  
    
Goal:
    The goal of this game is to earn as many points as you can in 60 seconds
    An order that has been made correctly will be rewarded with 100 points.  For every ingredient that is missing or is not supposed to be added, points will be deducted.
